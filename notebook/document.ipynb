September 2025\\nApplication for (Junior) Data Scientist (m/w/d) – Fokus auf LLMs und GenAI\\nDear Hiring Team,\\nI am excited to apply for the position of (Junior) Data Scientist ‒ Fokus auf Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) und GenAI at CHECK24. With a strong academic background in software\\nengineering and practical experience in Machine Learning, NLP, and LLMs, I am eager to\\ncontribute my expertise to further enhance your Mietwagenvergleich product.\\nDuring my end-of-study internship at Neofacto Luxembourg, I worked extensively on the\\nAira (AI Review Assistant) project, where I implemented and evaluated NLP and LLM models,\\ncontributed to the transition from OpenAI/GPT to LLAMA, and applied techniques such as\\nembedding, summarization, and classification. I also gained hands-on experience with\\nLangChain, PyTorch, TensorBoard, and dataset management for fine-tuning. In addition, I\\nam skilled in Python, Git/GitLab, and API development, and I have worked in agile Scrum\\nteams using Jira, all of which align well with the requirements at CHECK24.\\nBeyond technical expertise, I am highly motivated by the opportunity to bring\\nstate-of-the-art AI methods into real-world applications that reach millions of users. The\\nchallenge of not only building advanced models but also integrating and monitoring them in\\nproduction systems excites me greatly. I see CHECK24's dynamic and collaborative\\nenvironment as the perfect place to combine my analytical mindset, problem-solving\\nabilities, and enthusiasm for Generative AI with tangible customer impact.\\nI am fluent in English, French, and Arabic, and I am currently learning German to further\\nstrengthen my communication skills in a professional context.\\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and motivation match your vision\\nat CHECK24. Thank you very much for considering my application.\\nKind regards,\\nFatma Fendri\"),\n",
